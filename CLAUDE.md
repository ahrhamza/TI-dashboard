# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

---

> **SOCFeed** — Internal threat intelligence feed aggregator for a small SOC team (2 analysts).
> Self-hosted, Docker-based, accessible at `socfeeds.albatha.com`.
> Barebones but complete — utility over polish, mature UI over aesthetics.

## Project Overview

SOCFeed ingests RSS and JSON feeds from 33 curated cybersecurity sources, deduplicates
them, and presents analysts with a unified triage queue. Analysts can move items through
a defined lifecycle, raise helpdesk tickets, add notes, and maintain an audit trail —
all from a browser with no login required.

## Commands

### Full stack (Docker)
```bash
docker compose up --build        # build and start all services
docker compose up                # start without rebuilding
docker compose down
docker compose logs -f backend   # tail backend logs
```

### Backend (local dev)
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

## TI Lifecycle

```
INGESTED ──► IRRELEVANT ◄─────────────────────────────┐
         ──► TO_ADDRESS ──► TICKET_RAISED ──► RESOLVED │
                    ▲              │                    │
                    │              ▼                    │
                    └──── (any state) ────────────────►─┘
```

- **IRRELEVANT is reachable from any state at any time** — misclicks and
  reassessments are expected. Marking something irrelevant from `TICKET_RAISED`
  or `RESOLVED` is valid.
- **Lifecycle can restart from IRRELEVANT** — an analyst can move an irrelevant
  item back to `TO_ADDRESS` to begin the forward flow again.
- This means the only hard rule is: `TICKET_RAISED` requires a `ticket_id`.
  Everything else is freely transitionable.

All transitions are:
- Timestamped (`status_changed_at`)
- Attributed to the acting analyst (`status_changed_by`)
- Written to `audit_log` (full transition history preserved, e.g. INGESTED →
  TO_ADDRESS → IRRELEVANT → TO_ADDRESS → TICKET_RAISED)

**TICKET_RAISED** requires a `ticket_id` (non-empty string).
**RESOLVED** prompts for optional closure notes.

---

## Feed Polling

- Global cron interval: **10 minutes**, uniform across all sources
- On-demand refresh: POST `/api/refresh` — triggers immediate full poll
- **First ingest cap**: on a source's first poll, only the 3 most recent entries are
  ingested — prevents flooding the queue with a source's entire back-catalogue
- **Age filter**: on subsequent polls, entries with `published_at` older than 2 days are
  dropped; entries with no `published_at` always pass through
- Deduplication: `sha256(source_id + article_url)` — unique constraint on `dedup_hash`
- Same story from multiple sources: increments `seen_in_sources` counter on the
  canonical article; does not create duplicates
- **JSON feed formats supported**: standard JSON Feed (`items` array) and CISA KEV
  (`vulnerabilities` array — `cveID` used to construct NVD detail URLs, `dateAdded`
  as published date, sorted newest-first before ingest cap is applied)
- Auto-archive: articles older than **10 days** (minimum) with status `INGESTED` are archived
  (configurable via `ARCHIVE_AFTER_DAYS` in `.env`; minimum enforced at 10 days)
- Source auto-disable: `consecutive_failures >= 3` sets `is_active = False` and
  writes to audit log

---

## Source Management

### Add Source Flow
1. Analyst enters URL
2. Backend fetches feed and returns 3 sample articles (preview only, not ingested)
3. Analyst reviews samples, sets name and tier, confirms
4. Source is saved and included in next poll cycle
5. Duplicate check on both URL and name (case-insensitive) — 409 if either exists
6. Action written to audit log

### Source States
- **Active** — ingesting normally
- **Disabled** — manually paused (`is_active = False`); still visible in the list; can be re-enabled
- **Failing** — auto-disabled after 3 consecutive failures (`is_active = False`, `consecutive_failures >= 3`)
- **Archived** — hidden from the default list (`is_archived = True`); ingestion stopped; restorable

### Source Actions
- **Disable** — inline confirmation; sets `is_active = False`; written to audit log as `source_disabled`
- **Enable** — immediate; sets `is_active = True`, resets `consecutive_failures = 0`; written to audit log as `source_enabled`
- **Archive** — inline confirmation; sets `is_archived = True` and `is_active = False`; hidden from default list; written to audit log as `source_archived`
- **Restore (unarchive)** — immediate; sets `is_archived = False`, leaves `is_active = False` (analyst must re-enable); written to audit log as `source_unarchived`
- **Delete** — permanently removes an archived source; only available from the Archived tab; inline confirmation required; existing TI articles from the source are preserved; written to audit log as `source_deleted`

Archived sources are shown via the **Archived** filter tab in the source list. All other filter tabs (All / Active / Disabled / Failing) show only non-archived sources.

### Source Health
| Status   | Condition                                        | UI indicator |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Active   | `is_active=True`, 0 failures                    | Green dot    |
| Degraded | `is_active=True`, 1–2 consecutive failures       | Amber dot    |
| Disabled | `is_active=False`, fewer than 3 failures         | Amber badge  |
| Failing  | 3+ consecutive failures (auto-disabled)          | Red dot      |
| Archived | `is_archived=True`                               | Grey badge   |

---

## TI Card Design

Each card in the feed queue displays:

**Header row**
- Source name + tier badge
- Severity badge (colour-coded, muted: slate/amber/orange/rose — not neon)
- Keyword match tag if applicable (e.g. "⚑ APT28")
- "N sources" badge if seen across multiple feeds
- Timestamp — relative ("14 min ago"), full datetime on hover

**Body**
- Article title as an external hyperlink (opens new tab)
- Summary line (~160 chars max), greyed subtitle style
- Ticket ID when present — numeric IDs rendered as hyperlink to `ithelpdesk.albatha.com`
- Notes when present — indented with left border stripe, whitespace preserved

**Action row**
- Mark Irrelevant (muted styling) — available from any status; hidden when already Irrelevant
- Forward action button adapts to current status: To Address → Raise Ticket → Resolve
  - Raise Ticket: inline ticket ID input (required, Enter to confirm, Escape to cancel)
  - Resolve: inline optional closure notes textarea
  - IRRELEVANT shows "To Address" to restart the lifecycle
- Severity selector (inline `<select>`)
- ✎ Note — expands inline textarea; text is appended to existing notes, never replaced
- ▼ History — expands lazily-loaded audit trail (oldest-first); invalidated on each write
- Lifecycle status pill showing current state + time in state

**Ticket Raised cards additionally show**
- "Edit" link next to the ticket ID to update it inline

**Behaviour**
- All actions inline — no modals
- Irrelevant cards render at 55% opacity
- Chronological order, newest first, no pagination — virtualised scroll
- 3px left border stripe per severity (subtle, not dominant)
- All timestamps parsed as UTC to avoid local-time offset errors

---

## Feed Queue — Display & Ordering

- Default sort: **chronological, newest first** by `published_at`
- Filters: severity (multi-select), lifecycle status (multi-select), source tier (multi-select), source (searchable multi-select), keyword (multi-select — filters to articles matching any selected term), keyword mode (All / Keyword matches only / Highlight matches)
- Keyword filter selects by primary term; alias matches are transparent (selecting `rhel` finds articles that matched via any of its aliases)
- "Show irrelevant" toggle (off by default)
- "Show archived" toggle (off by default)
- Refresh button in header triggers on-demand poll and shows last-refreshed timestamp
- Timestamp display toggle in nav bar: Rel / Date / Both — persisted in `localStorage`

---

## User Identity

- First visit: modal prompts for analyst's name (required, non-dismissable)
- Name stored in browser cookie: `socfeed_user`, 90-day expiry
- All write actions tagged with this name
- No server-side auth — internal deployment only
- Cookie name editable in header area (e.g. "Viewing as: Sarah — change")

---

## Keyword Watchlist

- Managed from the **Sources page → Keywords tab** (moved from Settings)
- Terms matched case-insensitively against title + summary on ingest
- Only **active** (`is_active = True`) keywords are matched at ingest time
- Matches stored as comma-separated string in `articles.keyword_matches` — always uses the **primary term label**, never the alias string
- Matching articles get a flag indicator on their card
- **Disable** — term is retained but skipped at ingest; shown with strikethrough and grouped under "Disabled" in the UI
- **Enable** — reactivates a disabled term for future ingestion
- **Edit** — inline edit of both the primary term and aliases; updates all existing `keyword_matches` in articles to reflect the new primary term (backfill runs in the same transaction)
- **Aliases** — pipe-separated variant strings stored in `keywords.aliases`; any alias match at ingest stores the primary term label; the primary term and aliases can be completely different strings that mean the same thing (e.g. `rhel` with aliases `red hat linux|red hat enterprise linux`)
- **Alias backfill** — on startup and whenever aliases are saved, any article that has an alias string as its stored tag is corrected to the primary term
- Duplicate check on add (case-insensitive, 409)
- All changes attributed to analyst and written to audit log
- Examples to seed: `APT28`, `Lazarus`, `CISA`, `CVE-2026`, `Ukraine`, `Iran`,
  `ransomware`, `critical infrastructure`, `zero-day`

## Audit Log

Every significant action produces an audit entry:

| Action               | Trigger                                                              |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|

| `severity_change`    | Severity updated on a TI                                             |
| `note_added`         | Note written to a TI                                                 |
| `ticket_raised`      | Ticket ID recorded on a TI                                           |
| `source_added`       | New source confirmed and saved                                       |
| `source_disabled`    | Source manually disabled, or auto-disabled after 3 failures; detail includes source name |
| `source_enabled`     | Source manually re-enabled                                           |
| `source_archived`    | Source archived (hidden from list)                                   |
| `source_unarchived`  | Archived source restored to disabled state                           |

| `keyword_added`      | Watchlist term added                                                 |
| `keyword_disabled`   | Watchlist term disabled (retained but not matched at ingest)         |
| `keyword_enabled`    | Disabled watchlist term re-enabled                                   |
| `keyword_removed`    | Watchlist term permanently removed                                   |

UI: table view inside the Settings page (as a tab/section), filterable by user, action type, and date range. Audit is not a standalone nav item.

---

## Daily Digest

- Route: `GET /digest` — rendered as a clean HTML page
- Shows all items in `TO_ADDRESS` and `TICKET_RAISED` status
- Grouped by severity (Critical → High → Medium → Low)
- Each item shows: title, source, link, ticket ID (if raised), time in current state
- Print-optimised CSS — clean for screenshots or PDF export

---

## UI Design

### Principles
- **Mature and professional** — no terminal aesthetics, no hacker themes
- Inspired by tools like Linear, Notion, or a well-designed internal dashboard
- Information-dense but not cluttered
- Typography-first: readable at a glance under stress

### Theme
- Light mode and dark mode, toggled via a button in the header
- Persisted in `localStorage`
- Light: warm white background (`#FAFAF9`), dark slate text, subtle grey borders
- Dark: deep neutral background (`#0F1117`), off-white text, low-contrast borders
- Accent colour: a single muted blue (`#3B82F6`) for primary actions only
- Severity colours (both modes): slate / amber / orange / rose — muted, not neon
- No gradients, no shadows heavier than `shadow-sm`, no animations except
  subtle fade on card collapse

### Typography
- Font: Inter (Google Fonts) — clean, neutral, legible
- Title size hierarchy: clear but not dramatic
- Monospace (`font-mono`) only for ticket IDs, hashes, URLs

### Layout
- Fixed top navigation bar: logo/name, nav links (Feed, Sources, Settings), refresh button + last-refreshed
  time, light/dark toggle, analyst name
- Left sidebar (collapsible): filter panel — severity, status, tier, keyword flag
- Main content: virtualised card list
- No floating action buttons, no overlapping elements

## What Is Out of Scope (v1)

- User authentication or access control
- Email or Slack notifications
- Mobile layout optimisation
- Full-text search across article bodies
- External API for third-party integrations
- Multi-tenancy
- Scheduled/automatic exports

## Development Phases

| Phase | What exists for the user | Scope |
|-------|--------------------------|-------|
| 1 | Nothing — backend only ✓ | Docker Compose scaffold, FastAPI + SQLite, schema, RSS/JSON ingestion, dedup, 10-min cron, feed health tracking, source validation script |
| 2a | Read-only feed UI ✓ | React frontend: feed list (virtualised, newest-first), TI cards (title, source, summary, severity badge, keyword highlight, seen-in-N badge, timestamp), source tier filter, light/dark mode, user cookie + name prompt, refresh button |
| 2b | Full TI workflow ✓ | Lifecycle transitions (freely transitionable, IRRELEVANT restartable), notes inline, ticket ID capture + edit, closure notes, per-item transition history, severity editing, ticket hyperlinking, status filter triggers re-fetch |
| 3 | Source management ✓ | Source list with health indicators (green/amber/red dot), TI count per source, add-with-preview (3 samples), soft-delete with inline confirmation, per-source test button |
| 4 | Settings page ✓ | Keyword watchlist (add/delete, attributed to analyst, audit logged), audit log table (filterable by user/action/date, article targets link back to feed card with spotlight), `/digest` standalone HTML page (grouped by severity, print-optimised), `ARCHIVE_AFTER_DAYS` configurable from UI (persisted to `app_config` DB table, 10-day minimum enforced) |
| 5 | Data portability & reset ✓ | Import/export and destructive data controls in Settings > Data tab (see below) |
| 6 | UI polish & filter improvements ✓ | Multi-select filters, source filter, keyword highlight mode, context-aware timestamps (see below) |

### Phase 5 — Data Portability & Reset

**Export**
- Single-button export from Settings that produces a timestamped `.json` file containing:
  - All sources (including soft-deleted, so history is portable)
  - All TI articles with full status, notes, ticket IDs, severity, keyword matches
  - All audit log entries
  - All keyword watchlist terms
  - Export metadata: exported_at, exported_by, app version
- Everything needed to fully restore the intelligence state on a new instance

**Import**
- Upload a previously exported `.json` file
- Backend validates structure before applying anything
- Merge behaviour: sources and keywords are upserted; TI articles are upserted on `dedup_hash`; audit log entries are appended (no dedup — preserves full history)
- Import itself is written to the audit log: `import | user | N articles, M sources, K keywords restored`
- UI shows a preview diff before confirming: "This will add N new TIs, M new sources, K new keywords. Proceed?"

**Clear All TIs**
- Destructive button in Settings, visually distinct (muted rose, not prominent)
- Two-step confirmation:
  1. Confirmation dialog: "This will permanently delete all TI articles and audit log entries. Sources and keywords will be preserved."
  2. Password prompt: user must enter a pre-configured password (set via `CLEAR_PASSWORD` in `.env`) to proceed
- Deletes all rows from `articles` and `audit_log` tables
- Does **not** delete sources or keywords
- Writes a final audit entry before deletion: `clear_all | user | timestamp` (this entry survives since it's written to a separate log or output to server stdout)
- Intended for starting a fresh intelligence cycle, not routine use

### Phase 6 — UI Polish & Filter Improvements

**Multi-select filters**
- Severity, Status, and Source Tier filters changed from single-select radio to toggle-based multi-select
- Click a value to add it to the active set; click again to remove it; multiple values can be active simultaneously (e.g. Critical + High, or TO_ADDRESS + TICKET_RAISED)
- "All" button clears the selection and returns to unfiltered; a count badge on "All" shows how many values are currently selected
- Filter state stored as arrays: `severity: []`, `status: []`, `tier: []`

**Source filter**
- New "Source" section in the sidebar with a text search input and scrollable list of all sources
- Each source shows name (truncated) and tier badge; searchable by typing
- Multi-select: any number of sources can be active simultaneously
- "All sources" clears the selection; count badge reflects how many sources are filtered to

**Keyword highlight mode**
- Keywords filter section has two parts: a three-option mode radio and a keyword multi-select list
- Mode radio: "All articles" / "Keyword matches only" / "Highlight matches"
- "Keyword matches only" behaves like the old keyword flag (hides articles without matches)
- "Highlight matches" shows all articles but wraps every watchlist term found in the title or summary in an amber `<mark>` (case-insensitive, multiple matches per card, distinct in light and dark mode)
- Keyword multi-select: filter to articles matching one or more specific keywords; only active keywords shown; alias matching is transparent (primary term is what's compared)
- Watchlist term objects fetched from the API at load time alongside articles and sources

**Timestamp display**
- Timestamps changed from relative-only to context-aware:
  - Same day: `09:42 · 3h ago`
  - Different day: `Apr 3 · 2d ago`
- Three-mode toggle in the nav bar — **Rel** (relative only), **Date** (time or date only), **Both** (default)
- Persisted in `localStorage` per analyst; applied immediately without reload
